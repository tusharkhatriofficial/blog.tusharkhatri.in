# px vs em vs rem vs %. Which one do I use while designing web pages?

There are more than a few units to size an element using CSS. You might have wondered which one to use. let me help you choose the right one for your needs.

## Difference Between PX, EM, REM, and¬†%

let me make it simple for you:

`16px = 1em = 1rem = 100%`

If you are here to know about the conversion formula. 16px is generally the base size, and I‚Äôm considering 16px as the base size here:

**pixels to convert** √∑ **16 = em**

For example, If you are willing to convert `40px` to `em` and the base size is `16px` then:

`40√∑16 = 2.5em`

Now If you are still with me probably you want to learn about the core differences between these two.

**Core Difference:**

I will talk about `rem` later in this blog, for the time being, consider `em` and `rem` as the same units. So basically, `px` is a static unit but `em`, and `%` are dynamic units, let us understand this by an example.

Let me create an `index.html` file and link it with a CSS file

I will define the size of the text in the paragraph tag in pixels using CSS.

```css
.container {  
  padding: 40px;  
}

p {  
  font-size: 20px;  
}
```

and the output looks something like this:

Now let‚Äôs head over to the `chrome://settings/appearance` and change the font size to very large.

Now you will notice that the size of the Paragraph tag is not increasing even if we change the default font size and this is because pixel is a static unit and it stays as it is until we zoom in on the web page using `Ctrl ` and `+`.

Did you notice something unusual? I can see something changing its size. Oh! it is the `h1` tag, now all this is happening because the size of the `h1` tag is pre-defined in `em`, and as I told you `em` is a **dynamic unit**.

It is considered better to design your website using dynamic units as it helps people with visual impairments to scale up the text and makes your website much more reliable. `%` is also a dynamic unit. Which one you will use? well, it is up to you now.

### What is¬†rem?

Let me be quick. Let‚Äôs take an example:

`index.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">  
  <head>  
    <meta charset="utf-8">  
    <title>The Difference Between PX, EM, REM, %</title>  
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">  
  </head>  
  <body>  
    <div class="container">  
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>  
    </div>  
  </body>  
</html>
```

`css/styles.css`
```css
body {  
  font-size: 2em;  
}

.container {  
  padding: 40px;  
}

p {  
  font-size: 3em;  
}
```

In the above example, we have defined font size as `2em` for the body and `3em` for the paragraph tag. Now the sum of `2em` and `3em` is `5em` and this is what is gonna be displayed on the web page.

![web page with em and rem example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1666500987650/QKakaelzE.png)

**Even though the `2em` is crossed out, it still applies! making it a total of¬†`5em`.**

so, `rem` stands for **root em,** and using `rem` we can override the size defined for the body instead of inheriting it.

```css
body {  
  font-size: 2em;  
}

.container {  
  padding: 40px;  
}

p {  
  font-size: 3rem;  
}
```

After making the above changes the paragraph will have a font size of `3em` only.
